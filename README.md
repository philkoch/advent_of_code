ADVENT OF CODE
==============

Find the solutions I implemented for this years [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020). I decided to use [Rust]() to get to know the language a little.

For all solutions, keep in mind that I'm a beginner in using Rust, so you shouldn't view the solutions as well-implemented. However, the results should be correct.
